# pycmdtopdf
takes a command line arguments and generates a pdf file from the output

# Example
```
python app.py ls -a
```

```
.
..
.git
.gitignore
__init__.py
__pycache__
app.py
README.md
requirements.txt
```

This will generate a pdf and a text file with the content from the ls -a command.

Ideal usage would be if you want to share the output of a command with another person via email or some other means.
